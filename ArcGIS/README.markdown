# ArcGIS Maki style files

These are ArcGIS styles of the maki point of interest icon set.  Both Desktop (.style) and Server (.ServerStyle) versions are provided.  These style files can be used with ArcGIS 10.1 or higher products.

Currently only PNG based picture marker symbols are contained in these styles.  In addition to keeping up to date with maki symbols, the following roadmap is planned:

- 12/18/24 px versions of the PNG renders [DONE]
- vector versions created from SVG source
- vector versions created from SVG source with added white outline
- representation marker versions of the two above vector versions
